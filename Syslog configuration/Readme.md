### Syslog Configurations

In this lab, I configure the Syslog protocol in Cisco Packet Tracer. Syslog is a standard protocol used for network monitoring and event logging. It listens on UDP port 514 and allows devices to send their log messages to a centralized Syslog server for monitoring and analysis.

For more details on the configuration and network topology, please refer to the provided Packet Tracer file and configuration scripts.
